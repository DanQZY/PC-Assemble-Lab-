Refection on PC Assemble :
The PC Assemble give me an opportunity on better understanding about computer hardware and its functions.This experience has motivated me to further explore hardware and system building. I feel more confident tackling future upgrades or troubleshooting hardware issues. Additionally, it has sparked an interest in learning about advanced topics like overclocking and custom cooling solutions.
